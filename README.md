# Crowdfunding_ETL

ETL is a group project. This project demonstrates the process of building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. 
The extracted data is cleaned, transformed, and saved into Six CSV files, then used to create a database schema.
The final step is loading the data into a PostgreSQL database.
The QuickDBD diagram helps to understand the co-relation between the database.
